# txt_parse
A Python script that will log all filenames (and its content if saved in the .txt extension) within a specified directory.

## Installing
Make sure Python is installed on your computer.

## Using
Specify the directory that you want to parse through in the terminal. Once the script finishes, the terminal window will close. You can find the results in the log file that will be in the same directory as the Python file.
